# Node Interview


## Synopsis

This is a project made for a node job interview, it was made with express and mondodb as database.
  It is a simple app that scrape titles from the url's you wrote on input, where you can choose Promises or Callback to do it.


## Installation

For this project i am using mlab as database provider, so you have to register there and configurate a new Schema. Once you have your Schema created, make a config.json file following the config-sample.json file.
  When everything is ready just run npm install and npm start and go to localhost:8888 to see the app working.


## Usage

This app accepts multiple url's on it input, just need to be separated by a blank space. As a result you will see the title of each web, on green color if
is a new one, or in black color if it was previously required.
